# pirateaudio-spotipy

This is a simple Python script that interfaces with a Spotify account and the [Pirate Audio line out](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pirate-audio-line-out) HAT for a Pi Zero 2W. It displays the currently playing album on screen, and lets you pause, play and skip what is currently playing. I'm using [Raspotify](https://github.com/dtcooper/raspotify) to enable the Pi to act as a Spotify Connect target.
